				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<p>My name is Nate Brock. I am a Theatre: Design & Production Major and Interactive Digital Studies Minor, at the University of Northern Iowa.</p>
				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>I was born and raised in Iowa. I have lived in the Cedar Rapids area for most of my 22 years of life. One term that comes to mind when thinking about myself is "I'm a person who wears many hats." Why does this saying come to mind though? Probably because I am involved with a lot of things, like marching band, theatre, communications, games, etc. The list goes on.</p>
				<h2>What I actually do:</h2>
				<p>Beyond just my list of many activities, I do different things. I have been a member of two different marching bands over a span of seven years. I have been doing backstage theatre work for six years and counting. I have started doing content creation, things like videos, livestreams, coding projects, and much more.</p>
				<h2>What am I up to now?</h2>
				<p>Currently I am working on a number of projects, one of which is this website! Other things I am working on include but are not limited to: preparing to graduate from college, improving my artistic abilities, starting to get into voice acting, and streaming more often at <a href="https://twitch.tv/brock4691" target="_blank">Twitch</a>.</p>
