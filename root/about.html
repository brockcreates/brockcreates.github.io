			<div id="aboutme">
				<h2>Hello!</h2>
				<p>My name is Nate Brock. I am a Theatre: Design & Production Major and Interactive Digital Studies Minor, at the University of Northern Iowa.</p>
				<p>I was born and raised in Iowa. I have lived in the Cedar Rapids area for most of my 22 years of life. One term that comes to mind when thinking about myself is "I'm a person who wears many hats." Why does this saying come to mind though? Probably because I am involved with a lot of things, like marching band, theatre, communications, games, etc. The list goes on.</p>
				<h2>What have I been studying?</h2>
				<p>Throughout my college career, I have mostly been studying Theatre: Design and Production, specifically focusing on lighting. More recently I have shifted my focust towards audio and video. I also study Interactive Digital Studies, with a focus on digital imaging. I have learned an extensive amount about the Adobe Creative Suite, and how it can be use in graphic design. I have also learned quite a lot about some of the machines and processes that are used in printing. I even learned how to create websites from the ground up, which is how this one was made! During the pandemic, I started teaching myself about voice acting, and game design. </p>
				<h2>What are my plans after graduating?</h2>
				<p>After my planned graduation after the Fall 2021 semester, I plan to use the variety of skills I have learned to work at recording studios, both behind the scenes and as a vocal talent. I eventually intend to find ways I can apply my skills to develop video games.</p>
